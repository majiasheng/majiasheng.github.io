    content: `A friend who is just getting started on learning programming reached out to me and asked "... is learning the meaning/usage/definition of a command line the most important about coding? ... I can probably search all the [command lines] of a specific program on google; and syntax is too annoying. ... I want to understand how to 'learn' first."
    I thought he was referring to command line (cli), so I gave him some background of command line and the difference between cli and GUI programs.
    However, I was quick to assume because he later aligned me on what he really was trying to understand
    that got me to think back to how I started - i was too, unsure of where to begin and what questions to ask. So direction is very important in learning, not just programming but all learnings as well.
    helping people getting started in learning how to code is part of the main reason why i started this *posts* section
