    content: `A friend who is just getting started on learning programming reached out to me and asked: 
    "... is learning the meaning/usage/definition of a command line the most important about coding? ... I can probably search all the [command lines] of a specific program on google; and syntax is too annoying. ... I want to understand how to 'learn' first."
    I thought he was referring to command line (cli), so I gave him some background of command line and the difference between cli and GUI programs.
    However, I was quick to assume because he later aligned me on what he really was trying to understand, which is if he should memorize all the syntax of the language he's trying to learn.
    That got me thinking back to how I started -- I, too, was unsure of where to begin and what questions to ask. Right questions/words are the north stars in the journey. So *direction* is very important in learning, not just programming but all other disciplines as well.
    Helping people getting started in learning how to code is part of the main reason why I started this *posts* section.

    Going back to my friend's original question, I answered him with the analogy of spoken languages:
    Programming languages' syntax is analogous to our spoken languages' grammar, alphabets/characters, and words. 
    It's normal to not have all the syntax of a programming language memorized when you are just getting started. It's like most people don't know all the English words or words in other langauges. 
    That's why dictionary and documents of grammar rules exist; and that's why we have documentations in programming languages.
    Most of us as professionals rely on documentations of the technology/language we use all the time. 
    It's completely normal to not being able to memorize everything.

    To extended the conversation a little further, I added that if he's going to call himself a xxx (name of programming lanaguage) programmer, then he is assumed to speak the language fluently, meaning, he should not rely heavily on documentations on basic syntax.

    Of course, I encouraged him to have fun at the end of the conversation. It's an important part of learning.
