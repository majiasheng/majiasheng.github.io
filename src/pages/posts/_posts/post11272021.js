    <h2>0. Foreword</h2>
    This post is intended to serve as an overview for new comers in app development.
    When I first started, I have little idea in what are all the relevant pieces in app development, and there is a myriad of terms that I wish I knew and their connections to the context.
    I will try to include as many relevant terms as possible. It's okay if you don't understand all of them,
    because it's my intention to expose you to new terms so you will have an easier time connecting the dots when you come across them down your learning path.

    There are a few main steps in building an application end to end, they are:
    1. Design
    2. Develop
    3. Test (repeat 1 and 2 when needed)
    4. Deploy

    <h2>1. Design</h2>
    First thing first, to start any project, there's going to be a design phase. 
    In this very first step, we are putting ideas in concrete terms and actionable items.
    For example, say we want to make a vending machine. 
    First, we will need to define the scope of work; namely, what do we want the vending machine to do (what are the *features*)?
    With this question in mind, we are coming up with use cases, which will provide direction for us to make technical decisions such as programming lanauge, algorithm, architecture, and etc.

    <h2>2. Develop</h2>

    This is part where coding starts. Some people think this is what a programmer/coder/software engineer does mostly, but this is just part of the whole app development.
    You may not need a 100% well thought out design, but having a design of the
